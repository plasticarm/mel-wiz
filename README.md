automation mel scripts
mel-wiz is a suite of scripts useful for automation in Maya.
There are many scripts designed for generation of variants by creating ranges for randomization of any attributes.

Installation :
source > wiz.mel

then enter mel command : installLocalWiz

select the directory the scripts are in.

A shelf button should be created for started wiz.mel

You many need to click on the shelf button twice to start the suite of scripts since there is some error that is yet to be resolved since Maya2018.
