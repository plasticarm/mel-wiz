//This is simple template of 3D-Coat's script. Script language is very close to c++ and based on angelscript.
//You will usually see it if you used Scripts->Create new script
//Read general syntax description at http://angelcode.com/angelscript/sdk/docs/manual/doc_script.html and
//http://angelcode.com/angelscript/sdk/docs/manual/doc_understanding_as.html
//But if you know c/c++ it will be easy to write scripts. For beginning you may just use mostly one command 
//cmd("Some UI command");
//With this command you may execute any item in UI. It is easy to get UI item command - hover required comamnd in UI and press MMB and RMB simultaneously. 
//Corresponding command will be copied to clipboard. You may read about other commands in scripting manual.

//declare any global variables if need, don't write commands ritght there, do it in main() of any other function. 
//...
int nfiles;

//This function will be called once when script will be run  
//insert any commands there. Start from cmd as described above.
void main(){
	nfiles=0;
	// next command is optional, just to keep control of execution in modal message boxes (see description of ModalDialogCallback below), if you are new you may delete or ignore next line
	SetModalDialogCallback("ModalDialogCallback");
	//shows message box if need
	if(ModalDialogOkCancel("Just write description there"," ")){
		//This function will call void ForAnyFile(string &in FileName) for each file in user defined folder - jpg and png are just for example 	
		ForEachFileInFolder("","*.png;*.jpg","ForAnyFile");
		ModalDialog(formatInt(nfiles,'l')+" files processed."," ");	
	}
}

//This function will be called for each file in user-defined folder  
void ForAnyFile(string &in FileName){
	//print there just for example, use Scripts->View execution log
	print(FileName + "\n");
	nfiles++;
}

//This function is mostly for advanced users. When you are calling or getting some modal message box you are loosing control until user will press some button there. 
//But each time when modal dialog will be show this function will be called and you may do some action inside modal message box   
void ModalDialogCallback(){
	// Example of command - press first button in message box (uncomment next line if need)
	//cmd("$DialogButton#1");/*press OK*/
